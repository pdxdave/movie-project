# movie-project
A movie search project

This project uses the movie database found at ```https://www.themoviedb.org/```.   This is a free API service that does require registration.    

Developer information can be found at ```https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction```    

The possiblities are quite extensive, but by no means does this project incorporate everything available on the API. It will however do the following:

1. Load a banner image for a movie
2. Pull up a list of popular movies
3. Have a button to load more movies
4. Click on a movie title and populate another page with information about that tilte
5. Have a search bar to look up specific movie titles
