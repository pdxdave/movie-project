## What we'll be using

Some of the information on ```themoviedb.org``` is not very easy to find.  For this reason I will post some of the more difficult stuff to find here.

### Posters, Logos, Profiles

```
{
  "images": {
    "base_url": "http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/",
    "secure_base_url": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/",
    "backdrop_sizes": [
      "w300",
      "w780",
      "w1280",
      "original"
    ],
    "logo_sizes": [
      "w45",
      "w92",
      "w154",
      "w185",
      "w300",
      "w500",
      "original"
    ],
    "poster_sizes": [
      "w92",
      "w154",
      "w185",
      "w342",
      "w500",
      "w780",
      "original"
    ],
    "profile_sizes": [
      "w45",
      "w185",
      "h632",
      "original"
    ],
    "still_sizes": [
      "w92",
      "w185",
      "w300",
      "original"
    ]
```

Here are the approximate sizes...
